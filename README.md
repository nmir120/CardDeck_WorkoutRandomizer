This application uses the public 'card-deck' npm package to simulate a randomized workout.
The randomization technique is inspired by one of my favorite Youtube fitness experts, Jeff Nippard.
His video explaining this "game" can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLrkT4F7tEc
If you don't have a deck of cards, this application is perfect for you (plus its much quicker than drawing a bunch of cards and figuring out how to translate it).
